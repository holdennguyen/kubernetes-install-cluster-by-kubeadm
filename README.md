# Bootstrapping Kubenetes Cluster with kubeadm on Virtual Box
This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes Cluster on a local machine using VirtualBox.
We will use Vagrant to automate provisioning VirtualBox's VM.

## Before you begin
* Cluster diagram: 1 Control Plan & 2 Node.
* Instructions for Linux disto based on Debian and Red Hat. (I will use Ubuntu)
* System resources: at least 2 GB of RAM and 2 CPUs per machine.
* Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster (public or private network is fine).
* Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node.
* Must disable [swap]() in order for the kubelet to work properly.
* Certain ports will be open on your machines. See [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/ports-and-protocols/) for more details.
* The client certificates generated by kubeadm will be expired after 1 year. See [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-certs/) for more details.
